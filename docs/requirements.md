2. Problem Statement & Why This Matters
2.1 Challenges in the Current Job Market
1️⃣ Recruiters Ignore Applications – Many jobs remain open, but recruiters stop checking applications.
2️⃣ Inactive Job Seekers – Many registered users are not actively applying for jobs.
3️⃣ High Hiring Costs – Small businesses struggle to afford recruitment agencies.
4️⃣ No Affordable ATS – Small employers do not have an efficient way to track applicants.
5️⃣ Lack of Incentives for Job Seekers to Refer Others – Companies give referral bonuses to employees, but job seekers miss out.

3. Solution – India Employment Hub’s Unique Approach
3.1 Active Jobs System
💡 How It Works:
If a recruiter does not check applications for 7 days, the job is marked as passive.
Passive jobs get lower visibility in search results until the recruiter engages again.
Encourages recruiters to actively manage their postings.
🔹 Benefits:
✅ Ensures job listings remain relevant.
✅ Increases employer accountability.
✅ Helps job seekers apply for jobs that are actively reviewed.

3.2 Active Candidates System
💡 How It Works:
If a job seeker does not apply for jobs for 4 days, their profile moves to passive mode.
Employers will see “Active & Engaged” candidates first.
Passive candidates can reactivate their profile anytime by applying for jobs.
🔹 Benefits:
✅ Reduces clutter from inactive job seekers.
✅ Improves response rates for recruiters.
✅ Keeps the hiring ecosystem fresh and updated.

3.3 Free ATS (Applicant Tracking System) for Employers
💡 How It Works:
Employers get a basic ATS for free to manage job applications.
Features include:
Application Status Tracking – See who applied, shortlisted, interviewed, or hired.
Automated Follow-Ups – AI prompts recruiters to respond to candidates.
Candidate Comparison – Easily compare applicants.
Premium ATS features available with a subscription plan.
🔹 Benefits:
✅ Helps small businesses manage hiring efficiently.
✅ Reduces dependency on expensive third-party ATS platforms.
✅ Improves employer-candidate engagement.

3.4 Referral & Affiliate System
Affiliate Program (For Job Seekers)
💡 How It Works:
Job seekers earn points/credits for referring others to apply for jobs.
Credits can be used for:
Resume Highlighting – Stand out in job listings.
Discounts on E-learning Courses (via platform partnerships).
Premium Job Alerts & Career Services.
🔹 Benefits:
✅ Encourages job seekers to invite others.
✅ Makes job applications more interactive and engaging.
✅ Gives job seekers additional career-boosting benefits.
Referral Bonus (For Employers & Job Seekers)
💡 How It Works:
Organizations can offer a smaller referral bonus (lower than employee referral bonuses).
If a job seeker refers to someone who gets hired, they earn a cash reward.
Reduces reliance on recruitment agencies.
