# IEH: The AI-Native Recruitment Engine (Seed Round)

## 1. The Thesis: CapEx to OpEx Shift
Traditional recruitment platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed) scale linearly with headcount. IEH is different. By replacing manual recruiter screening with **Gemini 2.0 Flash reasoning**, we convert high Fixed Costs (salaries) into low Variable Costs (tokens). This yields **software-like margins (85%+)** even in a service-heavy industry.

## 2. Unit Economics (At Scale)
Our financial model is built on "Outcome-Based" pricing, not just seats.

### A. The "AI-Native" Cost Structure (Monthly)
| Category | Cost Driver | Monthly Est (10k Users) | Strategic Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Intelligence** | Gemini Flash + Vector DB | ₹50,000 | Scales purely with usage. Zero dormant cost. |
| **Growth Engine** | LinkedIn Ads + Content | ₹1,50,000 | Aggressive acquisition. CAC < LTV/3 target. |
| **Core Engineering** | Founding Team + Tools | ₹1.5L - ₹2L | Lean team leveraging AI coding agents (Antigravity). |
| **Enterprise Operations** | Legal + Compliance | ₹55,000 | DPDP Compilance for Enterprise trust. |

### B. Revenue Velocity
- **Pro Tier (₹2,499)**: For active job seekers. High volume, low touch.
- **Enterprise (₹39,999)**: For hiring teams. High touch, extreme retention.
- **Projected ARR**: ₹3.5 Cr+ at just 2% market capture of target niche.

## 3. Use of Funds (Seed Round)
We are raising to prove the "Viral Coefficient" and "AI Efficacy".

1.  **Product Hardening (40%)**: Fine-turning the semantic matching engine with real-world feedback loops.
2.  **Growth Experiments (30%)**: Aggressive A/B testing on acquisition channels to find the <₹500 CAC sweet spot.
3.  **Operations & Legal (20%)**: Setting up the "Trust Infrastructure" for B2B sales (SOC2 compliance readiness).
4.  **Contingency (10%)**: Buffer for compute spikes during viral loads.

## 4. The "Unfair Advantage"
We don't just "use" AI; we are **built** on it.
- **Speed**: Matches in milliseconds, not days.
- **Accuracy**: Semantic understanding of "soft skills", not just keywords.
- **Cost**: 1/10th the cost of human-screened agencies.
