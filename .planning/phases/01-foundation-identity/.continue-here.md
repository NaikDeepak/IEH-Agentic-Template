<current_state>
We have completed Wave 1 (Plans 01-01 and 01-03) of Phase 1.
We were just about to start Wave 2, which consists of Plan 01-02 (RBAC System).
The execution of Plan 01-02 was interrupted before it could complete any tasks.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Plan 01-01 (Auth Expansion): Complete. Email/Password auth added, Register page created.
- Plan 01-03 (Admin Dashboard): Complete. Admin layout and dashboard scaffolding created.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Plan 01-02 (RBAC System):
  - Task 1: Update UserData Type (add 'admin' role)
  - Task 2: Create ProtectedRoute Component
  - Task 3: Update RoleSelection logic
  - Task 4: Secure App Routes
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Used `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
- Implemented nested routing for `/admin` section.
- User roles defined as: 'seeker' | 'employer' | 'admin'.
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None blocking the current plan.
- Note: `tests/functions.test.ts` failing build due to missing types, but not blocking UI work.
</blockers>

<context>
We are in the middle of Phase 1 execution. Wave 1 built the foundation (Auth + Admin UI). Wave 2 is about securing it. Plan 01-02 is critical because it restricts access to the admin routes created in 01-03 and enforces the auth logic built in 01-01.
