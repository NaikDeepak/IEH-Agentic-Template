<objective>
Enable testing of the ATS Kanban board by adding required navigation and generating sample application data.

Purpose: Close the accessibility and data gaps identified in UAT for the ATS feature.
Output: Navigation links for managing jobs and a functional seeding script for applications.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add "Manage Jobs" Navigation</name>
  <files>src/components/Header.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Add a "Manage Jobs" link to the employer navigation in the Header.
    This should link to '/jobs' (or a dedicated employer job management page if it existed, but '/jobs' with ownership filtering is the current pattern) to allow employers to find their posts and click through to "View Applicants".
  </action>
  <verify>Log in as an employer and verify the "Manage Jobs" link appears in the desktop and mobile navigation.</verify>
  <done>Employers have a clear path to reach the applicant pipeline for their jobs.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Application Seed Script</name>
  <files>scripts/seed-applications.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create a script that populates the 'applications' collection in Firestore.
    The script should:
    1. Take a job ID as an argument (or find the first available job).
    2. Create 5-10 mock applications with varied statuses ('applied', 'screening', 'interview', 'offer', 'rejected').
    3. Include mock candidate details (name, email, mock resume summary).
    4. Use 'admin.firestore()' to bypass client-side rules for fast seeding.
  </action>
  <verify>Run 'npx tsx scripts/seed-applications.ts [jobId]' and verify applications appear in Firestore and on the Kanban board.</verify>
  <done>The ATS Kanban board is fully testable with varied candidate cards.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Navigation check: Link exists and works.
- Data check: Kanban board is non-empty after running the seed script.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- "Manage Jobs" link present in Header for employers.
- scripts/seed-applications.ts exists and successfully adds documents to Firestore.
- Kanban board renders with at least 5 candidate cards.
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-employer-suite/04-05-SUMMARY.md`
