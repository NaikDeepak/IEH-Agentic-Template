# Plan: 06-06 - Seeker Referral Dashboard & Point Redemption UI

## Goal
Provide a central hub for seekers to manage referrals and spend their points.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Component: `ReferralDashboard.tsx`
- Create in `src/features/growth/components/`.
- Show:
  - Personal Referral Code (with copy button).
  - Total Points Balance.
  - Referral History (Status of people referred).
  - Verification Status (Checklist).

### 2. UI: Redemption Store (Placeholder)
- List items that can be "bought" with points (e.g., "Premium AI Analysis", "Course Voucher").
- Implement `LedgerService.spendPoints(uid, amount, itemId)`.

## Verification Plan
1. Access the Referral Dashboard.
2. Copy and share the code.
3. See points balance update in real-time.
4. Attempt a redemption; verify balance decreases correctly.
