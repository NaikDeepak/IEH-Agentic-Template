# Plan: 06-02 - Phone Verification (OTP) Flow

## Goal
Implement Firebase Phone Auth to verify user mobile numbers as a trust signal.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Component: `PhoneVerification.tsx`
- Create in `src/features/growth/components/Verification/`.
- Use `RecaptchaVerifier` for the "Send Code" button.
- Implement `signInWithPhoneNumber` or `linkWithPhoneNumber`.
- Success state: Set `phoneVerified: true` in Firestore.

### 2. Service: Auth Extension
- Add `verifyPhone(phoneNumber, verificationCode)` to a new or existing auth helper.

## Verification Plan
1. Trigger phone verification.
2. Receive OTP.
3. Enter correct OTP.
4. Verify `phoneVerified: true` in Firestore.
