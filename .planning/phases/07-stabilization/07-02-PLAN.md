# Plan: 07-02 — E2E Smoke Tests (Playwright)

## Goal
Write Playwright E2E tests covering the 3 critical user paths to catch regressions before deployment.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup
- Create `e2e/` directory with Playwright config pointing at `localhost:5173`.
- Add test fixtures: mock Firebase Auth state, seed Firestore data for test users.
- Configure `playwright.config.ts` with `webServer` to auto-start `npm run dev`.

### 2. Test: Seeker Registration → Login → Apply
- Navigate to registration page.
- Create account with test credentials.
- Verify redirect to Seeker dashboard.
- Navigate to job listings, click a job, submit application.
- Verify application appears in tracker.

### 3. Test: Employer Login → Post Job → View Applicants
- Login as employer demo account.
- Create a new job posting via AI JD generator.
- Verify job appears in Manage Jobs list.
- Navigate to ATS Kanban; verify pipeline loads.

### 4. Test: Referral Flow
- Register User A → verify referral code generated.
- Register User B with User A's referral code.
- Complete verification steps as User B.
- User B applies to a job.
- Verify User A receives Brownie Points.

## Verification Plan
1. Run `npm run test:e2e` — all 3 tests pass.
2. Tests run against local emulator suite.
3. Screenshot artifacts captured for failed tests.
