# Plan: 07-10 — UX Polish & Loading States

## Goal
Eliminate flash-of-unstyled-content, blank screens during data fetches, and unprofessional loading artifacts across all user-facing pages.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Skeleton Loading Components
- Create reusable `<SkeletonCard>`, `<SkeletonTable>`, `<SkeletonText>` components.
- Replace all "Loading..." text placeholders with shimmer skeletons on:
  - Job listing cards
  - Seeker dashboard stats
  - Referral dashboard
  - ATS Kanban pipeline
  - Company profile page

### 2. Empty State Illustrations
- Create meaningful empty state components for:
  - "No jobs found" (with suggestion to adjust search)
  - "No applications yet" (with CTA to browse jobs)
  - "No referrals yet" (with CTA to share code)
- Replace any raw "No data" text with designed empty states.

### 3. Toast Notification System
- Implement a toast/notification system for transient feedback:
  - "Job posted successfully"
  - "Resume analysis complete"
  - "Referral code copied"
  - "Application submitted"
- Use consistent positioning (bottom-right) with auto-dismiss.

### 4. Form UX
- Add inline validation with real-time feedback on all forms.
- Add submit button loading states (spinner + disabled) during async operations.
- Add success confirmation screens after major actions (job post, application submit).

## Verification Plan
1. Navigate to each major page — no "Loading..." text visible, skeletons appear instead.
2. Perform major actions — toast notifications appear with correct messages.
3. Submit forms with invalid data — inline errors appear without page navigation.
