<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Implement Scheduled Follow-up Nudges Function</name>
  <files>functions/src/followUpNudges.ts, functions/src/index.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create a scheduled Firebase Cloud Function (running daily) that:
    1. Queries for applications in 'applied' or 'interviewing' status that haven't been updated in 7 days.
    2. Updates a `needsFollowUp` flag and `nudgeReason` in the application document.
    3. Ensure it only targets active applications.
    Export the function in `functions/src/index.ts`.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "onSchedule" functions/src/followUpNudges.ts && grep "followUpNudges" functions/src/index.ts</verify>
  <done>Infrastructure for identifying applications needing follow-up is in place.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Follow-up Nudge UI Component</name>
  <files>src/features/seeker/components/ApplicationBoard/FollowUpNudge.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create a component to display a "nudge" (e.g., a badge or a specific card styling) on applications that have the `needsFollowUp` flag set.
    Include a suggested action (e.g., "Send a follow-up email").
    Integrate this component into the Seeker's Kanban board cards.
  </action>
  <verify>ls src/features/seeker/components/ApplicationBoard/FollowUpNudge.tsx && grep "needsFollowUp" src/features/seeker/components/ApplicationBoard/FollowUpNudge.tsx</verify>
  <done>Seekers can visually identify which applications require their attention.</done>

<success_criteria>
System automatically flags stale applications and nudges the seeker.
