<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Implement Assessment Service</name>
  <files>src/features/seeker/services/assessmentService.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create a service that uses Gemini to:
    1. Generate 5 multiple-choice or short-answer questions for a specific skill.
    2. Grade the answers and determine if the user has "verified" proficiency.
    3. Update the user's Firestore profile with the "Verified" badge upon success.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "generateAssessment" src/features/seeker/services/assessmentService.ts && npx tsc src/features/seeker/services/assessmentService.ts --noEmit</verify>
  <done>Skill assessment logic is implemented and can verify skills.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Skill Proofs UI</name>
  <files>src/features/seeker/components/Assessments/SkillProofs.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Implement a UI for:
    - Selecting a skill to verify.
    - Taking the assessment by calling `assessmentService.ts`.
    - Displaying the result and "Verified" status.
  </action>
  <verify>ls src/features/seeker/components/Assessments/SkillProofs.tsx && grep "Verify" src/features/seeker/components/Assessments/SkillProofs.tsx</verify>
  <done>User can take assessments and see their verification status in the UI.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Check for existence of service and UI components.
