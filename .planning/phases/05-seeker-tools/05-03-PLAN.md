<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Implement applyToJob Service and Action</name>
  <files>src/features/jobs/services/jobService.ts</files>
  <action>
    Implement `applyToJob(jobId, seekerId)` which:
    1. Creates a new application record in the `applications` collection.
    2. Links it to the job and seeker.
    3. Sets initial status to 'applied'.
    Update job detail UI to include an 'Apply' button if not already applied.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "applyToJob" src/features/jobs/services/jobService.ts && npx tsc src/features/jobs/services/jobService.ts --noEmit</verify>
  <done>Seekers can successfully apply to jobs, creating the necessary records for tracking.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Refactor KanbanBoard into a Generic Component</name>
  <files>src/features/applications/components/KanbanBoard.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Refactor the existing `KanbanBoard.tsx` (Employer-facing) to be generic and reusable.
    - Extract shared logic (dnd-kit setup, column mapping).
    - Allow passing custom column definitions and card components.
    - Ensure it still works for the Employer view.
  </action>
  <verify>npx tsc src/features/applications/components/KanbanBoard.tsx --noEmit</verify>
  <done>Generic KanbanBoard component ready for both Employer and Seeker use.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Implement Seeker Tracker Service and Board</name>
  <files>src/features/seeker/services/trackerService.ts, src/features/seeker/components/ApplicationBoard/ApplicationBoard.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Implement `getSeekerApplications(seekerId)` in `trackerService.ts`.
    Create `ApplicationBoard.tsx` for seekers by reusing the refactored `KanbanBoard`.
    Seeker Columns: Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected.
  </action>
  <verify>ls src/features/seeker/components/ApplicationBoard/ApplicationBoard.tsx && grep "KanbanBoard" src/features/seeker/components/ApplicationBoard/ApplicationBoard.tsx</verify>
  <done>Seeker can manage their application pipeline visually using the shared Kanban infrastructure.</done>
